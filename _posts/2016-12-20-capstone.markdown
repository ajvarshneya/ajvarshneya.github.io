#### Capstone: Wizard's Chess

My capstone at UVA was building a robot chess board. We did a lot of hardware work and some C/Python programming.

Code is [here](https://github.com/SebastianJay/chECEckm8).

<style scoped>
    .container {
        position: relative;
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 560px;
        height: 0;
        padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    }
    .video {
        position: absolute;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>
<div class="container">
