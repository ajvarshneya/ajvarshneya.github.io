#### Wireless Remote / Display

I made a MSP430-controlled rotor-remote and receiver as a solo project for my embedded final. It is something like a TV-remote. The project uses concepts we covered in the class including SPI, switch debouncing, Manchester coding, and parity checking. I used two MSP430's, a TR1000 chip (wireless communication), a CAT4008 chip (number display), a Panasonic EVEG encoder (knob), and two header boards the instructors provided.

Code is [here](https://github.com/ajvarshneya/embedded_final).
