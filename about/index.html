I’m an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia pursuing a degree in computer science with a second major in computer engineering. I do research with UVA’s HPLP and CAP groups where my current project explores implementing hierarchical temporal memory on a MISD architecture. I love computers and am interested in developing software at all levels of abstraction.
